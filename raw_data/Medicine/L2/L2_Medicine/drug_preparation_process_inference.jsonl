The text also notes the introduction of social medicine in Latin America and the United States in the 20th century, particularly highlighting the contributions of Salvador Allende in Latin America during the 1930s and a resurgence of interest in social medicine in the U.S. after World War II.What role does scientific research play in the context of public health according to the text?

This integration does not stem from a comprehensive understanding of social medicine's principles within academia, which limits the effective communication of its significance and value. Therefore, it is crucial to systematically establish the relationship between preventive and social medicine and to enhance understanding among academic and related fields. One proposed approach is to rename the preventive medicine course to \"preventive and social medicine,\" aligning with practices in many other countries. Adjusting and supplementing the course content accordingly would aid in solidifying the academic and practical identities of both preventive and social medicine. The growing international interest in the social determinants of health is evident, with many European medical schools introducing social medicine as a subject, and some American universities establishing departments that include social medicine. This indicates that social medicine is indeed a recognized specialty within the field of medicine. However, it remains underutilized in the Korean medical community. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve two objectives: first, to describe the origins and evolution of social medicine to enhance understanding within the Korean medical field; and second, to outline the current state of social medicine in Korea and propose agendas for its development. The core concept of social medicine emphasizes the significant impact of social and economic conditions on health, disease, and healthcare services, highlighting the need for scientific research in this area.

The Mendelians were concerned with distinct inheritance patterns, while the Biometricians sought to understand how continuous variation could coexist with these discrete factors.

Initially, 1.80 g of silica nanoparticles is dispersed in 90 mL of ethanol. A solution of freshly prepared [Ag(NH3)2]+ ions is then added to this dispersion, followed by sonication at room temperature for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the mixture is combined with 300 mL of a PVP ethanol solution, with PVP serving as both a stabilizer and a reductant. The reactions are conducted at varying temperatures (30/50/70 \u00b0C) for different durations (2/4/5/7 hours) to form the silver nanoshells (SiO2@Ag). The optimal conditions for producing these nanoshells are at 70 \u00b0C for 7 hours; extending temperature or time beyond this may lead to undesirable precipitation. Finally, the products are washed with ethanol and deionized water, followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 minutes to separate the resulting materials.What is the optimal temperature and duration for the formation of silver nanoshells using the described preparation method?
