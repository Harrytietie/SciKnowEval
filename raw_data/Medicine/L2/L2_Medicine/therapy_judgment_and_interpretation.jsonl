After World War II, discussions on social medicine became active in the United States; however, the term 'social medicine' was avoided by the medical community due to its phonetic similarity to 'socialized medicine', which implied a state-managed healthcare system. This aversion intensified during the McCarthyism era in the early 1950s, which targeted alleged communists. Consequently, social medicine was not introduced to the Korean medical community, which developed through exchanges with American medicine. Social medicine addresses health and disease issues at both individual and population levels, recognizing that population health concerns require a societal perspective for understanding and resolution. Therefore, identifying determinants and solutions for health and disease issues from a social medicine viewpoint is essential. Although the term social medicine is rarely used in Korea, its concepts are partially incorporated into the preventive medicine curriculum. This incorporation lacks a foundation in the academic discourse surrounding the principles of social medicine, which limits the understanding and communication of its significance and value. Therefore, a clear understanding and systematization of the relationship between preventive medicine and social medicine is necessary. A practical approach could involve renaming the preventive medicine course in medical schools to 'preventive social medicine', aligning the content accordingly to enhance understanding and establish the academic and practical identities of both fields.Is it true that the concepts of social medicine are fully integrated into the Korean medical community's curriculum without any limitations?

The researchers faced the challenge of determining the appropriate dosage for an elephant, noting that transient rage had been elicited in cats with an intravenous dose of at least 0.15 mg/kg and similar doses in other small mammalian species. Consequently, they selected an intramuscular dose of 0.1 mg/kg for Tusko. Following the injection, the elephant exhibited marked incoordination, trumpeted, collapsed, defecated, and went into status epilepticus. Despite the initiation of treatment, Tusko died 1 hour and 40 minutes after the injection, prompting the investigators to seek an explanation for this unexpected outcome, considering the pharmacological effects within the species.Based on the text, can we conclude that the administration of LSD to Tusko was safe and effective in mimicking the natural phenomenon of \"musth\" in elephants?

Many hospital laboratories were found to lack the necessary PCR infrastructure and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure the quality of the analytical phase for COVID-19 detection. Protocols developed by manufacturers are often tailored for manufacturing-oriented quality system regulations (QSRs), making them unsuitable for direct implementation in clinical laboratories that handle routine test volumes. Therefore, before introducing laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for COVID-19 detection, it is essential to modify and optimize these protocols to align with hospital laboratory requirements.

PT-VWD is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by both quantitative and qualitative defects in platelets, resulting from a gain of function of GpIb\u03b1, a subunit of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) receptor on the platelet membrane. This alteration leads to an increased avidity of GpIb\u03b1 for VWF, causing platelets to bind spontaneously to high molecular weight VWF multimers. The result is platelet clumping and enhanced clearance, which leads to thrombocytopenia and a reduction in VWF multimers. While this condition poses a risk for thrombosis due to enhanced platelet clumping, the predominant clinical manifestation is a hemorrhagic phenotype caused by thrombocytopenia and the augmented clearance of VWF multimers.Based on the text, can it be inferred that the primary clinical manifestation of platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) is related to an increased risk of thrombosis due to enhanced platelet clumping?

While candidate gene studies, which are based on hypothesized mechanisms of action, may exhibit greater statistical power compared to agnostic methods like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or whole genome sequencing (WGS), the chances of selecting the appropriate candidate gene can be extremely low. This issue is particularly pronounced in the field of addiction, where the pathophysiology is not as well understood as it is for oncologic or cardiovascular disorders, making candidate gene studies in this area more speculative. A recent review of pharmacogenetic studies focused on substance use disorders revealed that two-thirds of the twelve candidate gene studies related to opioid or cocaine abuse treatment had sample sizes of less than 200 and concentrated on only a few genetic variants.

Notably, a review of 39,000 illicit cannabis samples seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency revealed that the average THC content in these samples increased from about 4% in 1995 to 12% in 2014, while the CBD content decreased from 0.28% to less than 0.15% during the same period. This suggests that the cannabis used in the study, sourced from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), likely had significantly different THC and CBD levels compared to illicit cannabis.

For each additional hour of EBM training, there was a corresponding increase of 0.28 points in the mean score. The secondary outcomes showed a mean change of 11.9 points from baseline to one-month follow-up, with an estimated effect size of 0.75. Further multivariable analysis revealed that being part of the intervention group was associated with a 12.04-point increase, each additional year of age corresponded to a 0.37-point improvement, while being a woman was linked to a 6.10-point reduction in scores.Does the evidence from the study suggest that Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) training significantly improves post-test scores for participants compared to those who did not receive the training?

Notably, red bell peppers have a total carotenoid content of 280 \u00b5g/g, with capsanthin making up 60% of this total. Additionally, they contain 11% beta-carotene and 20% capsorubin. The presence of these compounds suggests potential health benefits, including genotoxicity reduction and superoxide radical scavenging activity, which may contribute to their radioprotective properties. Various studies have investigated the chemical constituents of aromatic plants, including Capsicum, for their radioprotective effects and the mechanisms through which they operate, such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in mitigating lipid peroxidation (LPO) and supporting white blood cell (WBC) function.Based on the text, can it be inferred that the presence of carotenoids in red bell peppers contributes to their radioprotective properties through mechanisms like electron paramagnetic resonance and reduced glutathione activity?

This method reduced experimental time from hours to several minutes and achieved an average recovery of approximately 131% with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 6%, which is superior to traditional biochemical methods that reported an average recovery of 107% with a CV of 14%. The LDI MS technique is not only fast and sensitive but also accurate, multiplex, quantitative, and reproducible without the need for enrichment or purification. Furthermore, it was utilized to monitor glucose levels in CSF for diagnosing postoperative brain infections, as glucose levels in CSF are more stable than in blood and play a crucial role in brain energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Notably, postoperative brain infections lead to decreased glucose levels in CSF due to the metabolic effects of surgery.Based on the text, can we conclude that the use of silver nanoshells-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) will always yield higher recovery rates than traditional biochemical methods for all types of metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid?
