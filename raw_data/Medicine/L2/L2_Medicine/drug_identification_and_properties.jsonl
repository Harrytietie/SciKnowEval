After World War II, discussions on social medicine became active in the United States; however, the term 'social medicine' was avoided by the medical community due to its phonetic similarity to 'socialized medicine', which implied a state-managed healthcare system. This aversion intensified during the McCarthyism era in the early 1950s, which targeted alleged communists. Consequently, social medicine was not introduced to the Korean medical community, which developed through exchanges with American medicine. Social medicine addresses health and disease issues at both individual and population levels, recognizing that population health concerns require a societal perspective for understanding and resolution. Therefore, identifying determinants and solutions for health and disease issues from a social medicine viewpoint is essential. Although the term social medicine is rarely used in Korea, its concepts are partially incorporated into the preventive medicine curriculum. This incorporation lacks a foundation in the academic discourse surrounding the principles of social medicine, which limits the understanding and communication of its significance and value. Therefore, a clear understanding and systematization of the relationship between preventive medicine and social medicine is necessary.

Although the platelet count is moderately reduced (80\u2013150\u200a\u00d7 \u200a10^9/L), patients may suffer from severe bleeding diathesis due to aspirin-like platelet dysfunction, necessitating laboratory diagnosis through platelet aggregometry in addition to genetic testing. The involvement of RUNX1 in disease pathogenesis may also explain the increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Another related condition is benign Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia (BMM), which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is observed in Greek and Italian populations, with throm-bocytopenia ranging from mild to moderate.What is the primary genetic factor associated with familial platelet disorders that predispose individuals to acute leukemia?

This integration does not stem from a comprehensive understanding of social medicine's principles within academia, which limits the effective communication of its significance and value. Therefore, it is crucial to systematically establish the relationship between preventive and social medicine and to enhance understanding among academic and related fields. One proposed approach is to rename the preventive medicine course to \"preventive and social medicine,\" aligning with practices in many other countries. Adjusting and supplementing the course content accordingly would aid in solidifying the academic and practical identities of both preventive and social medicine. The growing international interest in the social determinants of health is evident, with many European medical schools introducing social medicine as a subject, and some American universities establishing departments that include social medicine. This indicates that social medicine is indeed a recognized specialty within the field of medicine. However, it remains underutilized in the Korean medical community. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve two objectives: first, to describe the origins and evolution of social medicine to enhance understanding within the Korean medical field; and second, to outline the current state of social medicine in Korea and propose agendas for its development. The core concept of social medicine emphasizes the significant impact of social and economic conditions on health, disease, and healthcare services, highlighting the need for scientific research in this area.

It is important to note that the volume of distribution does not correspond to the actual volume of these compartments; rather, it serves as a model to help explain drug behavior.How does high plasma protein binding impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs like 99mTc-gluconate and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine?", "choices": {"text": ["It increases the volume of distribution significantly.", "It decreases the half-life of the drug.", "It results in a lower volume of distribution.", "It enhances glomerular filtration rate calculations."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "C", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "drug_identification_and_properties", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

The 1970s saw the introduction of Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) in clinical settings, followed by increased automation in laboratories during the 1980s. Since the 1990s, there has been a significant transformation in clinical laboratory management across several European countries with the implementation of ISO 15189 and ISO 22870 standards.
