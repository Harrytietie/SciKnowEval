However, the accuracy of data, such as Meeh's constant (a coefficient used to calculate body surface area), which is individualized for different species (e.g., 11.0 for humans and 9.0 for rats), is compromised due to significant errors in the original surface area data from which these constants were derived. Therefore, it is preferable to use standardized equations for more accurate measurements. The correlation between dose and body surface area is a simple expression of this allometric relationship, highlighting that while body surface area is used to proportionate doses, it does not necessarily determine dosing itself.

For example, a hypothetical drug has a therapeutic index of approximately 6.25, calculated as (125 ng/mL)/(20 ng/mL). To minimize fluctuations in drug response due to plasma concentration variability, it is generally desirable for a drug to reach or exceed 80% of its maximal activity.

In the CYP2A6 gene, polymorphisms have been identified that affect enzyme activity and nicotine metabolism. Individuals with CYP2A6 null variants, which make them genetically slow metabolizers of nicotine, have been found to have less severe nicotine dependence and are more likely to quit smoking compared to those with wild-type alleles. However, using CYP2A6 variants to predict the response to treatments for nicotine dependence is not feasible due to the complexity and cost of genotyping, as well as the lack of CYP2A6 variants that account for substantial variance.", "answer": "The text discusses the significance of the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) as a biomarker for nicotine addiction pharmacotherapy, highlighting how individuals with CYP2A6 null variants, leading to slower nicotine metabolism, tend to have less severe nicotine dependence and better quitting outcomes, though using these variants to predict treatment response is currently impractical due to genotyping complexities and insufficient variants.", "type": "gen", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "text_summary", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

The etiology of neurasthenia, as explained by Beard in 1881 and Ballet in 1908, was believed to be an organic lack of nerve force originating in the nerves, caused by intellectual strain and leading to pathological changes in the chemical structure of the central nervous system.
