One example is the drug primaquine (PQ), which has been used to manage malaria in areas where the disease is prevalent. However, military doctors noticed that some soldiers treated with PQ experienced jaundice, anemia, and symptoms of acute hemolytic anemia (AHA). It was later discovered that these individuals carried variants in the G6PD gene. As a result, current clinical practice recommends genotyping patients to determine if they have relevant G6PD gene variants that may make PQ use risky for them. Another example of personalized medicine is the drug imatinib, which is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

Instead, many behaviors labeled as food addiction might be better understood as normal responses to a culturally permissive, energy-rich food environment, rather than pathological processes.Can the activation of the brain's reward system by food be equated to neural sensitization seen in drug addiction, making food addiction as compulsive and persistent as drug addiction?", "answer": "No", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

One approach involves incorporating clinical sequencing into the standard care of newly diagnosed patients to provide more precise risk stratification and to guide the use of targeted therapies in initial treatment plans. Similarly to umbrella trials, disease-specific precision trials in newly diagnosed patients necessitate knowledge of the gene variants associated with a particular diagnosis. Furthermore, there should be disease-specific evidence linking these gene variants to prognosis and treatment outcomes. For instance, a trial of the Trk inhibitor larotrectinib for TRK fusion positive malignancies demonstrated a promising objective response rate of 91% in pediatric and adult patients with TRK fusions, but no responses were observed in patients lacking these fusions.

This is particularly advantageous compared to gold nanoparticles. The silver nanoshells show enhanced plasmon coupling and aggregation due to excess silver, which leads to increased light absorbance and a broader plasmon resonance peak as the loading ratio of silver increases.

This idea is supported by references to academic works that suggest educational diagnoses may reinforce existing social inequalities. On the topic of medicalization, the text defines it as the process by which behaviors are classified and treated as medical issues. This concept is widely accepted in medical sociology and challenges the bio-medical model of disability.

However, personal thresholds are established from individual longitudinal or legacy values of a measure, which may be unique to each individual. Some settings have found that personal thresholds work better than population thresholds, suggesting their usefulness in early detection strategies. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to collect individual data to determine if measures are abnormal, rather than relying solely on population-based thresholds (Goetz and Schork, 26).Are personal thresholds, established from individual longitudinal or legacy values of a measure, proving to be more effective in early detection strategies compared to population thresholds in medical science?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

Neurasthenia was believed to stem from a finite reserve of nervous energy, a theory particularly applied to women. Women were viewed as inherently weaker, with a highly sensitive nervous system that primarily consumed energy in reproductive processes. This perspective suggested that women's bodies were more fragile compared to men's and that their lifestyle should involve reduced activity to prevent overload, which could lead to sickness and weakness.

Further elaborating on the detrimental effects of modern life on the nervous system, Beard used the analogy of an electrical generator, which is designed to handle only a certain amount of energy; exceeding this capacity would cause it to shut down, similar to how the human body reacts to overload by developing neurasthenia.

An MoH representative highlighted the importance of understanding the relationship between specific doses and their effects, emphasizing that medical practices must be based on known and verifiable information, adhering to the medical canon. This stance leads to a reform that resisted calls to modify the underlying principles of biomedicine and ignored both the inclusive medicalization proposed by MC advocates and the exclusive approach favored by critics.

The therapeutic index can be determined from concentration-response data, and is calculated as the ratio of the concentration causing 50% toxicity (EC50) to the concentration causing 50% of the maximal desired activity (EC50). For example, a hypothetical drug has a therapeutic index of approximately 6.25, calculated as (125 ng/mL)/(20 ng/mL). To minimize fluctuations in drug response due to plasma concentration variability, it is generally desirable for a drug to reach or exceed 80% of its maximal activity. However, between 20% and 80% response levels, small changes in plasma concentrations can lead to significant changes in drug response. Furthermore, if aiming for 80% efficacy with a maximum of 20% toxicity, a therapeutic index of 1, corresponding to a concentration of 40 ng/mL, would be necessary. The text also mentions that pharmacodynamic variability between individuals is often considered greater than pharmacokinetic variability, indicating more fluctuation in how individuals respond to a drug than in how they absorb and process it.

It outlines a critical perspective on the process of how these types of addictions are often recognized and studied. According to some researchers, the typical process begins with hypothesizing a new class of addiction based on untested assumptions and strong beliefs. Following this, an ad hoc screening tool is created using a loose interpretation of the DSM diagnostic criteria for addiction. This tool is then used to gather data regarding its psychometric reliability, prevalence in different populations, and its correlation with known risk factors for established substance-related disorders. However, the results are frequently miscommunicated as being more valid than they may actually be.

However, in the UK, the threshold for initiating levothyroxine substitution has decreased from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/l. This shift is noteworthy because the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, and feeling cold (referred to as \"frozenness\" in the text), are prevalent among 20-25% of individuals who have a normal TSH range between 0.3 and 5.1 mIU/l. Additionally, recent studies, including one from Japan, have shown no significant difference in symptoms between subclinical hypothyroid patients and euthyroid (normal thyroid function) control subjects, suggesting that the symptoms alone are not reliable indicators of subclinical hypothyroidism.

However, the accuracy of data, such as Meeh's constant (a coefficient used to calculate body surface area), which is individualized for different species (e.g., 11.0 for humans and 9.0 for rats), is compromised due to significant errors in the original surface area data from which these constants were derived. Therefore, it is preferable to use standardized equations for more accurate measurements. The correlation between dose and body surface area is a simple expression of this allometric relationship, highlighting that while body surface area is used to proportionate doses, it does not necessarily determine dosing itself.

It argues that the practice of psychiatry has been overly influenced by economic interests, the availability of numerous treatment options, and a public demand for psychological remedies, all legitimized by an authoritative 1000-page guidebook. This convergence has overshadowed common sense and sound judgment in the field. The author, who served as the Chair of the Stony Brook University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences for 18 years, notes a shift in psychiatric training and practice towards primarily diagnosing disorders according to the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and prescribing medication for a wide array of complaints. This approach has been reinforced by the undeniable benefits of certain drug classes on specific illness groups, promoting a paradigm that may be too narrow to adequately address the complexities of psychiatric disorders.Is the author suggesting that the current psychiatric practice, driven by economic interests and a reliance on the DSM for diagnosis, may be overlooking the nuanced nature of psychiatric disorders and relying too heavily on medication as a solution?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

These changes typically involve control over resources necessary for growth and development. For instance, studies have shown that disorders of human pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction can be attributed, at least in part, to conflicts between the mother and offspring over maternal resources during pregnancy. One example of this conflict is seen in the regulation of glucose levels in maternal blood. The fetus is selected to maintain higher levels of glucose, achieved by releasing chemicals into the maternal blood that increase the mother's resistance to insulin. In response, the mother produces more insulin. However, if this evolved tug-of-war system becomes dysregulated or if the fetus \"wins\" and the mother develops gestational diabetes, it can lead to health complications.

Here is a reorganized and coherent paragraph:\n\nMicrobial behaviors, such as cheating and cooperation, can have a significant impact on human infectious diseases. Some genotypes exploit the benefits of cooperation without incurring the costs, leading to the selection of mechanisms that limit exploitation. These mechanisms include repression of cheaters, pleiotropy between cooperative and essential traits, and conditional regulation of cooperative phenotypes. These behaviors directly influence microbial population dynamics, virulence, transmission, and the effectiveness of human strategies in reducing the health impacts of infectious diseases. Infectious disease virulence, which plays a major role in health effects, can be associated with microbial intrahost genetic relatedness in three different ways according to current theory.

The process of drug transport across membranes involves various mechanisms. Facilitated diffusion does not require energy and cannot move against a concentration gradient, but if a drug closely resembles the natural ligand, it can bind to carrier macromolecules and traverse the membrane. Active transport also relies on the drug's similarity to the natural ligand, allowing it to bind to carrier macromolecules; however, this process uses energy to transport a drug against the concentration gradient. Other carrier-mediated transport mechanisms, like P-glycoprotein, exist for nonspecific drug transport. Pinocytosis involves incorporating the drug into a lipid vesicle for carrier-mediated transport into the cell cytoplasm.

On the other hand, if the dose is escalated quickly and boldly, there is a significant risk of severe toxicity to the patient. Interestingly, there is often a 1:1 relationship between the lethal dose in 10% of mice (LD10) and the human maximum tolerated dose, which aids in determining safe and effective dosages for humans. This relationship is demonstrated through a comparison of mouse LD10 values and estimated human maximum tolerated doses for 17 different anticancer agents, including antimetabolites and alkylating agents, as shown in a study cited by Collins et al in JCO Pharmacology 1995.

This is especially true in the case of addictive disorders, as their pathophysiology is not as well understood as oncologic or cardiovascular disorders. Candidate gene studies in addiction are more speculative compared to other areas of medicine. A recent review of pharmacogenetic studies of substance use disorders found that out of 12 candidate gene studies on opioid or cocaine abuse treatment trials, two-thirds had sample sizes of less than 200 and focused on a single or a small number of genetic variants.

Medicalization often carries a stigma, but in elite circles, such as in Djursholm, being labeled with a medical diagnosis like dyslexia can confer a positive status. This status is linked to Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s theory of cultural and symbolic capital, suggesting that medical diagnoses among elites can lead to the acquisition of critical resources and further establish their social standing. Thus, medicalization not only empowers the elites but also reinforces social distinctions, contributing to the reproduction of class structures in society.

On the other hand, the Biometricians, led by Karl Pearson, focused on continuous or graded phenotypes, such as height, which raised concerns about reconciling continuous variation with the discrete factors considered by the Mendelians. Ronald Fisher argued that continuous phenotypic variation can be reconciled with discrete, heritable factors that contribute to this variation. He suggested a way to bridge the gap between the two perspectives.Did Ronald Fisher propose a solution that reconciled the viewpoints of Mendelians and Biometricians in the debate about inheritance patterns in medical science?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

Here is the reorganized and coherent paragraph:\n\nPredictive models in medical science aim to provide information about the effects of a specific therapeutic intervention, while prognosis models aim to predict a certain outcome regardless of therapy. However, there is often a risk of overfitting the model due to the number of extracted features being larger than the number of patients in a cohort. To prevent overfitting, increasing the number of samples used to train the model is the best solution. Although clinical data is abundant compared to research trial data, sharing between institutes has proven to be difficult due to ethical, political, and administrative issues. An alternative approach to large datasets is to reduce the number of features to a subset of the most relevant ones. Various filtering-based techniques for feature selection can be used, such as the univariate Fisher score and Gini index tests, or multivariate algorithms like mutual information or Conditional infomax feature extraction. These techniques help identify and select a subset of features based on prediction.Do filtering-based techniques for feature selection, such as the univariate Fisher score and Gini index tests, help in identifying and selecting a subset of features based on prediction in medical science?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

This perspective is supported by the biopsychology of hedonic eating, which examines how individuals derive pleasure from eating, particularly in an environment that promotes obesity. However, there are significant criticisms of the food addiction model. Critics argue that the model may lead to the unnecessary medicalization of natural motivational needs, as the behaviors attributed to food addiction could also be explained by normal psychological adaptations to an unhealthy lifestyle in a socio-culturally influenced obesogenic environment.

Consecration is essential for transforming formal authority into socially recognized and legitimate influence, as noted by Weber in 1946. This process involves sanctifying various aspects of power, thereby legitimizing them. The role of institutions, like schools, is highlighted by Bourdieu in 1996, who suggests that they can elevate individuals by altering their behaviors, essentially giving value to people. Durkheim, in 1973, extends this idea to the sanctification of everyday things and people, making consecration a widespread societal phenomenon. Furthermore, Sandgren in 2018 underscores the intense and significant role of consecration in elite schools, which often defines their function. Thus, consecration is not only a critical mechanism for exerting influence and elevating individuals socially based on aspects like education or lifestyle but also offers an alternative concept to socialization in the study of elites.Can consecration be seen as a process that transforms formal authority into socially accepted influence, according to the text's discussion on the significance of consecration in societal structures?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

The trial randomized 680 patients to receive resuscitation with a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:RBCs or a 1:1:2 ratio. Although there was no significant difference in 24-hour and 30-day mortality between the two groups, the 1:1:1 group had a significantly decreased risk of exsanguination and increased hemostasis compared to the 1:1:2 group. Additionally, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies involving 5,292 patients found that patients who received a high plasma:RBC ratio (approaching 1:1) had significantly reduced mortality compared to those who received a low ratio (\u22641:2).

The most effective new small-molecule (kinase inhibitors) and biologic (antibody) cancer therapies offer as little as 6 to 36 months of disease-free survival before cancer progression. However, the major challenge for cancer therapy is to block the growth of drug-tolerant or resistant cancer cells that underlie progression and to kill metastatic cells that have broken free of the primary tumor mass and intravasated into a blood or lymphatic vessel. Small molecules and biologics have a difficult time being sentinels as they cannot turn themselves on and off, relying entirely on specific molecular recognition to determine whether or not they act.

Therefore, there is a need to supplement the content of preventive medicine with the principles of social medicine to facilitate its systematic development in Korea.Does the Korean approach to preventive medicine lack attention to the fundamental concepts and principles of social medicine?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

Additionally, Rhein exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on mast-cell degranulation in rats and suppressed lipoxygenase enzyme activity. It was also found to block the increase of PAI-1 mRNA expression and protein production, inhibit the activity of phosphor-p44/p42 MAP kinase induced by TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in human endothelial cells, and inhibit IL-1-induced secretion of MMPs and aggrecanases in intervertebral disc cells. These findings suggest that Rhein may have potential as a treatment for vascular diseases and could be beneficial in protecting against endothelial dysfunction.Based on the information provided, does Rhein show potential as a treatment for vascular diseases and protecting against endothelial dysfunction?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

This approach has gained popularity in healthcare settings in the United States. Researchers are currently studying the potential benefits of integrative health in various situations, such as pain management for military personnel and veterans, symptom relief in cancer patients and survivors, and programs promoting healthy behaviors. The term 'integrative health' is used to refer to the incorporation of complementary approaches into mainstream healthcare.Is the incorporation of complementary approaches into mainstream healthcare the primary focus of integrative health care?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}

One specific example of this is the increased potential transmission of schistosomiasis due to global warming. Research has shown that global warming would result in the northward extension of disease epidemic areas, leading to an increase in transmission of schistosomiasis japonica. This finding is based on a biology-driven model and is part of efforts to break the cycle of infectious diseases and poverty. Recommendations for trans-disciplinary research priorities in this area include addressing environmental changes, innovative technology, social determinants, and health systems.Could the northward extension of disease epidemic areas due to global warming lead to an increased transmission of schistosomiasis japonica, as suggested by the biology-driven model?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Medicine", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "hypothesis_verification", "subtask": "", "source": "PubMed"}}
