Only a few studies did not clearly state cost-effectiveness due to reasons such as uncertainty, patient population limitations, or assumptions about comparative therapy. The quality of the evidence available was deemed to be high.

The therapeutic index can be determined from concentration-response data, and is calculated as the ratio of the concentration causing 50% toxicity (EC50) to the concentration causing 50% of the maximal desired activity (EC50). For example, a hypothetical drug has a therapeutic index of approximately 6.25, calculated as (125 ng/mL)/(20 ng/mL). To minimize fluctuations in drug response due to plasma concentration variability, it is generally desirable for a drug to reach or exceed 80% of its maximal activity.

Here is the reorganized and coherent paragraph:\n\nIn medical science, there is a growing recognition of the importance of establishing \"personal thresholds\" for measures as opposed to \"population thresholds.\" Population thresholds are determined based on epidemiologic and population survey data and are commonly used to determine disease status, such as a cholesterol level greater than 200 for heart disease or a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg for hypertension. However, personal thresholds are established from individual longitudinal or legacy values of a measure, which may be unique to each individual. Some settings have found that personal thresholds work better than population thresholds, suggesting their usefulness in early detection strategies.

This ratio is determined by the ratio of the nicotine metabolite 3\u2019hydroxycotinine to cotinine. The metabolism of nicotine is carried out by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2A6. In the CYP2A6 gene, polymorphisms have been identified that affect enzyme activity and nicotine metabolism. Individuals with CYP2A6 null variants, which make them genetically slow metabolizers of nicotine, have been found to have less severe nicotine dependence and are more likely to quit smoking compared to those with wild-type alleles. However, using CYP2A6 variants to predict the response to treatments for nicotine dependence is not feasible due to the complexity and cost of genotyping, as well as the lack of CYP2A6 variants that account for substantial variance.What could explain the observed differences in nicotine dependence and quitting success between individuals with CYP2A6 null variants and those with wild-type alleles?

It discusses the historical context of diseases like neurasthenia, which was initially considered an organic disease and popular in the 19th century, but lost its standing when it was reclassified as a psychiatric condition due to a shift in the relationship between psychiatry and neurology. Similarly, the text mentions the renaming of long-term exhaustion as either Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), reflecting patients' desires for their conditions to be recognized as legitimate, somatic illnesses. This change in naming also illustrates broader societal and medical dynamics, as noted by Shorter in 1992. Furthermore, the impact of societal changes on medical knowledge is explored through the examination of typically female diagnoses over time, such as hysteria, agoraphobia, and anorexia, citing works from Annandale (2009), Bordo (1992), Moscucci (1990), and Moss and Dyck (2002).

The problem lies not in the modified AFDO scheme itself but in the intrinsic limitations of new drug development. Despite these challenges, the modified AFDO scheme has proven useful in reducing the risks associated with first-time-in-human studies by using all available data and schemata to estimate the most conservative initial dose, followed by a common-sense approach to dose escalation.

This finding led to the first prospective trial of treatments for nicotine dependence that was stratified using NMR (nicotine metabolite ratio), representing a departure from the typically small size of addiction pharmacogenetic studies. The trial included over 1,200 smokers who were categorized as slow or fast metabolizers and randomly assigned to different treatment groups. The treatment groups consisted of a placebo patch and placebo pill, a nicotine patch and placebo pill, or varenicline and placebo patch. The results showed that fast metabolizers of nicotine had significantly higher quit rates when treated with varenicline compared to the nicotine patch. On the other hand, slow metabolizers of nicotine had similar quit rates across both treatments but reported more severe adverse effects with varenicline treatment.
